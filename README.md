# Classification Project

This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze employee attrition data. The code performs data exploration, handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and trains classifiers. It evaluates the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The project also includes a visualization of the decision tree and an assessment of the random forest classifier.
